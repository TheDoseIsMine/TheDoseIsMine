- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheDoseIsMine
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Programming, Game Dev, Web Dev, Digital Art and Tattooing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create a 2D Platformer using Unity, I am excited to see what I can achieve.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this game, if you would like to, I will soo finish my website Digital Derive and you could contact me through there.
- 📫 My website is currently under construction, soon I will be available through there.
- 😄 Pronouns: I.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have no idea what I am doing. "Update" I'm starting to know a little about what I am doing.

-Programming isn't just a career; it's my passion. Whether crafting immersive 2D side-scrollers, experimenting with game mechanics, or building the next epic journey, I'm always chasing the  thrill of creating something extraordinary.

 When I'm not in Unity bringing ideas to life, you might find me debugging at 2 AM with coffee in hand, plotting new adventures for my characters, or leveling up my skills in the ever-   expanding realm of game dev.

 Life’s a game, and I’m here to make it legendary. Let's build worlds together.
